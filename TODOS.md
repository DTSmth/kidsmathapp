# TODOS

## P3 — Design Debt

### AnimalMascot Mood Variants
Add a `mood` prop to `AnimalMascot` component: `neutral | happy | excited | wistful`. Each mood uses CSS transforms only — no new assets. `excited`: slight forward lean + scale(1.05). `wistful`: slight droop + opacity 90%.

**Why:** PaywallGate uses the mascot with a 😕 emoji overlay as a workaround — functional but not polished. PracticeSelect uses ⚡ overlay. A `mood` prop would make these screens feel intentional.
**Effort:** S (human: ~1h / CC: ~10 min)
**Priority:** P3
**Workaround in use:** Emoji overlay (`😕`, `⚡`) positioned absolutely over neutral mascot.
**Where to start:** `frontend/src/components/characters/AnimalMascot.tsx` — add `mood` prop with CSS class map.

---

### DESIGN.md Maintenance
Keep `frontend/DESIGN.md` up to date when new components are added or design decisions change.

**Why:** A stale DESIGN.md is worse than none — it creates confusion when following outdated specs.
**Effort:** S (ongoing — ~5 min per new component)
**Priority:** P3
**How:** Add a checklist item to any PR that introduces new UI components: "Did you update DESIGN.md?"

---

### Sound Effects
Add audio feedback for correct/wrong answers using the Web Audio API (no audio files — generate simple tones programmatically). Add a mute toggle in the header or settings.

**Why:** For kids ages 5-8, audio cues reinforce the reward loop. A cheerful "ding" on correct and a soft "whomp" on wrong are proven engagement signals in ed-tech research.
**Effort:** S (human: ~2h / CC: ~15 min)
**Priority:** P3
**Depends on:** MVP completion (quiz flow must exist first)
**Where to start:** Create `src/hooks/useQuizSounds.ts` using `AudioContext`, expose `playCorrect()` and `playWrong()` functions. Add `<SoundToggle />` component to Header.

---

### CI/CD Pipeline
Add a GitHub Actions workflow that runs `mvn test` and `npm run lint` on every push to master.

**Why:** Without CI, test regressions only get caught when you remember to run tests locally. As the test suite grows (25+ cases added in this plan), this becomes critical.
**Effort:** S (human: ~2h / CC: ~15 min)
**Priority:** P2
**Where to start:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — two jobs: backend (`mvn test`) and frontend (`npm run lint && npm run build`). Add Postgres service container for backend tests.

---

### Flyway Production Baseline
Before any real production deployment, add a Flyway V0 baseline migration (capturing the current schema from `ddl-auto` output) and a CI step that validates all migrations apply cleanly.

**Why:** Flyway V1 (unique constraints) is added in the MVP. Without a V0 baseline, future team members can't bring up a clean DB from migrations alone — they need to rely on `ddl-auto=create`, which is dangerous in prod.
**Effort:** S (human: ~3h / CC: ~15 min)
**Priority:** P2
**Depends on:** CI/CD pipeline (run migration check in CI).
**Where to start:** Run `mvn flyway:baseline` against the local DB to capture the current schema, then commit the resulting `V0__baseline.sql`.

## P2 — Phase 2 (After MVP Ships)

### JWT Token Refresh Endpoint
Add `POST /api/v1/auth/refresh` that accepts a valid JWT and returns a new one with a fresh 24h expiry.

**Why:** The current pre-flight expiry check (added in MVP) warns parents when their session is < 30 min from expiry, but doesn't silently refresh. A child mid-lesson on day 2 would still hit this edge case.
**Effort:** M (human: ~4h / CC: ~20 min)
**Priority:** P2
**Depends on:** Nothing — standalone backend feature
**Where to start:** `AuthService`, add `refreshToken(String token)` method; new `RefreshResponse` DTO; update `SecurityConfig` to permit the new endpoint without auth.

---

### Answer Rate Limiting
Add rate limiting to `POST /api/v1/questions/{id}/check` — 60 checks/minute per authenticated user.

**Why:** Currently anyone with a valid JWT can call this endpoint in a loop to discover correct answers programmatically. Low risk for a kids app but required before any public launch.
**Effort:** S (human: ~2h / CC: ~10 min)
**Priority:** P3
**Depends on:** Nothing — add Bucket4j dependency, configure in `SecurityConfig` or as a filter.

### ~~Engagement Engine~~ ✅ DONE + QA'd (2026-03-20)
~~Build inventory, leaderboard, streak calendar, daily bonus, rank levels, and item drops.~~

Shipped in commit `3885cc6`. Inventory, leaderboard (family + per-game), streak calendar, daily bonus, rank levels (STARTER→LEGEND), and item drops are live. QA found and fixed 6 bugs in commit `da67172`:
- Game leaderboard 500 (String→GameMode type mismatch)
- `isCurrentChild`/`isNewPersonalBest`/`isToday` boolean serialization (Lombok `isXxx` + Jackson pattern)
- `newItem` missing from lesson submission response
- Double star awarding on first lesson completion

---

### ~~Games Section~~ ✅ DONE (2026-03-19)
~~Build `GameController`, `GameService`, and the frontend games browser + game flow using the already-seeded `Game` and `GameScore` entities.~~

Shipped in commit `b269ae4`. All 5 games (Number Pop, Counting Critters, Shape Safari, Math Race, Pattern Parade) are live with full game engines, `GamePlay.tsx`, `GameComplete.tsx`, and `GameScore` persistence.

### Adaptive Difficulty Engine
Track per-child accuracy per topic (rolling 10-question window) and automatically serve questions from the appropriate difficulty bucket (EASY/MEDIUM/HARD enum already on `Question` entity).

**Why:** This is the product differentiator that transforms KidsMathApp from a "content player" into a "learning engine." A child who aces 10 easy addition questions should get medium ones. A child struggling with hard subtraction should get easy ones. The `Difficulty` enum on `Question` is already in place.
**Effort:** XL (human: ~2 weeks / CC: ~2h)
**Priority:** P2
**Depends on:** Games section ✅ (done). **RankLevel from the Engagement Engine plan is a ready input signal** — CHAMPION+ kids can default to MEDIUM questions, LEGEND kids to HARD, without needing per-topic accuracy tracking as a prerequisite.
**Where to start:** New `AccuracyTracker` service that maintains a rolling per-child-per-topic accuracy score; modify `QuestionService` to query by difficulty bucket matching current accuracy. For a fast first version: use `RankLevel` as a proxy before full accuracy tracking is built.

---

### Seasonal Events Infrastructure
Build limited-time item drops tied to calendar dates (Winter Math Festival: Dec 1-31, Back-to-School: Sep 1-30). Kids return for limited-time cosmetic items.

**Why:** Seasonal urgency is the strongest known retention driver after streaks. The `AvatarItem.unlockCondition` field introduced by the Engagement Engine plan supports time-bounded conditions (e.g., `{"type": "date_range", "start": "12-01", "end": "12-31"}`). The infrastructure is ready — seasonal events just need a banner + a time-window check in `ItemDropService`.
**Effort:** M (human: ~3d / CC: ~20 min)
**Priority:** P2
**Depends on:** Engagement Engine (AvatarItem + ChildInventory tables must exist first).
**Where to start:** Add `seasonStart` and `seasonEnd` fields to `AvatarItem`. Add a `SeasonalBannerComponent` to Dashboard. Seed 3-5 seasonal items per season in DataSeeder with date-bounded conditions.

---

### Ghost Race Share URL
`GameScore.answersLog` already stores per-answer timing for ghost race replay. A future "Share your best run" feature could encode the answersLog into a short share URL, letting kids share a replay with friends or parents.

**Why:** Social sharing creates organic acquisition — parents share kids' achievements, siblings challenge each other. The data is already captured; only a URL encoder + replay renderer is needed.
**Effort:** M (human: ~2d / CC: ~20 min)
**Priority:** P3
**Depends on:** Ghost Race mode (Engagement Engine plan).
**Where to start:** Encode `answersLog` as a base64 URL param. Build a `/replay/{gameId}?run={encoded}` page that plays back the ghost animation without requiring login.
